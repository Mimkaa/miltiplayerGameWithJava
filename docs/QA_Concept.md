## Version Control And Collaboration

#### 1. Branching Strategy
* Use the main branch for the most up-to-date and stable code.
* Pull the latest state from main before creating a feature branch.
* Each team member works on their own branch, commit changes frequently descriptive messages.
* Merge feature branches into main only after they pass code review and testing, and receive the group's approval.

#### 2. Commit message  Conventions
* Write meaningful commit messages.
* Include references to issues for traceability.

## Coding Standards
#### 1. Documentation
* Use Javadoc comments in the code to explain methods and improve code readability.
* Have a README.md at the root that describes the project goals, how to compile/run tests, and how to contribute.

#### 2. Coding Guidelines
* Adhere to standard Java conventions (naming, indentation, etc.).
* Use Checkstyle plugin to automatically enforce coding standards.


## Code Review
* One team member reviews the code. He checks for
   * Code readability
   * Proper exception handling
   * Adequate coverage
   * Alignment with coding standards

## Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
####  Team Collaboration
* Conduct regular short meetings to discuss upcoming tasks and overall project health.
* Keep team members updated on changes and progress via our Discord channel.
* Conduct a weekly meeting to discuss what went well and what could be improved.
